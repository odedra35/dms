	1. Create and Launch an EC2 Instance (Oregon Region)
		○ Log in to the AWS Management Console.
		○ Navigate to EC2 and launch a new instance.
		○ Choose Ubuntu as the operating system.
		○ Select the instance type according to your needs (e.g., t2.micro).
		○ Choose the Oregon Region (us-west-2).
		○ Configure your instance (network, subnet, etc.) as required.
		○ Generate a new key pair (e.g., Moni.pem) or use an existing one.
		○ Launch the instance and note the public IPv4 address.
		
	2. Once your EC2 instance is running, connect to it using SSH:
	
	ssh -i <path to Moni.pem> ubuntu@<public IPv4 address>
	
	• Replace <path to Moni.pem> with the path to your PEM file and <public IPv4 address> with the EC2 instance's public IPv4 address.
	
	3. To ensure the system is up-to-date and has the necessary packages for the application, run the following commands: 
	
	sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 -y && sudo apt install git -y

	4. Clone the required repository from GitHub:

	git clone https://github.com/odedra35/dms.git
	
	5. Install pip, the Python package installer, to manage Python dependencies:
	
	sudo apt install python3-pip
	
	6. Change the directory to the cloned dms repository:
	
	cd dms
	
	7. Checkout the dev branch to ensure you are working with the correct version of the code:

	git checkout dev
	
	8. Install the necessary Python packages listed in the requirements.txt file. The --break-system-packages flag ensures that the installation does not break the system package dependencies:

	pip install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages
	9. Grant executable permissions to the routes.py file:

	
	chmod 777 routes.py
	10. To allow the application to be accessed from outside the EC2 instance, open TCP port 8080 using the following command:

	
	sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp
	
	11. Finally, run the routes.py script using Python 3:
	
	python3 routes.py
